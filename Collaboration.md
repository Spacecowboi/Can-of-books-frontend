* Discord, Slack, Face-to-face.

3. How often will you take breaks?

4. What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

* Get help from ChatGPT, if that fails, move to asking instructor (Jacob) for help.

### Cooperative 

1. Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

* Anthony - Strong with working with front-end applications. Ensuring proper HTML/React structure is implemented properly. Class construction, applying HTTP methods for initial GET requests.

* Samaad - Good with working with backend tools such as making API calls (requests), understanding HTTP flow, and making sure libraries and imported frameworks are working to connect with databases.

2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

* Easy. Anthony will work frontend, and help backend as necessary. Samaad will work backend, and help frontend as necessary.

3. In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

* Anthony - Making sure state is working properly, understanding when to update/change existing states.
* Samaad - Understanding where to put our responses from the backend in regards to sending them to the frontend.

4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

* Take our time to understand the design flow and implement necessary changes as they come up. 

### Conflict Resolution

1. What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

* Will talk to teammate first, before escalating to instructor. Try to resolve conflict at the lowest level.

2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

* Same approach as question 1.

3. How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

* If there are gaps in knowledge, do best to help the other get up to speed, and if that doesn't work, reach out to our instructor to see what we can do next.
