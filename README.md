**Author**: Anthony Cunningham
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

* We want to create an application that allows a user to keep track of what books have deeply impacted them and allow them to display those books so others can have recommendations to read as well.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

1. Import all necessary frameworks and libraries
2. Setup required variables to access imported frameworks
3. Build out necessary class constructors on front-end to build objects that are received from backend 
4. Grab all the objects and packages from necessary databases and convert them into JavaScript objects. 
5. Build out render methods to display imported packages
6. Deploy (Frontend - Netlify) (Backend - render)

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
